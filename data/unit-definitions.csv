Consists of green and purplish-red, fine-grained, micaceous, ripple-laminated, fossiliferous siltstone and shale; dark-green, medium- to coarse-grained, thin-bedded, glauconitic sandstone; and interbedded purplish-red and brown, thin-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained, ripple-laminated sandstone. Includes gray, thin-bedded, fine-grained, micaceous silty dolomite in upper part in western quarter of map area. Intertonguing and facies change relations with the underlying Tapeats Sandstone produce variable thickness trends. Contact with Tapeats Sandstone is arbitrarily marked at lithologic vertical and lateral transition from predominantly green siltstone and shale to predominantly brown sandstone above Tapeats Sandstone cliff. About 350 ft (107 m) thick in east quarter of map area, thickening to about 500 ft 153 m) in northwestern quarter, thinning to about 150 ft (46 m) in southwest quarter. In cross section only."
Cm,Muav Limestone,#ebebcc,"Dark-gray, light-gray, brown, and orange-red, cliff-forming limestone, dolomite, and calcareous mudstone. Includes, in descending order, unclassified dolomites, Havasu, Gateway Canyon, Kanab Canyon, Peach Springs, Spencer Canyon, and Rampart Cave Members of McKee and Resser 1945. These members consist of fine- to medium-grained, thin- to thick-bedded, mottled, fossiliferous, silty limestone, limestone, and dolomite. Three unnamed slope-forming siltstone and shale units of Bright Angel Shale lithology are positioned between cliff-forming members of Muav Limestone. These unnamed siltstone and shale units are green and purplish-red, micaceous siltstone, mudstone, and shale, and thin brown sandstone. Contact with the underlying Bright Angel Shale is gradational and lithology dependent. Contact is arbitrarily marked at base of lowest prominent limestone of Rampart Cave Member of the Muav Limestone in west quarter of map area, and at base of limestone of Peach Springs-Kanab Canyon Members of the Muav Limestone in east three-quarters of map area. All members of the Muav Limestone thicken from east to west across map area and thin south to the south edge of map area. However, the Peach Springs, Spencer Canyon, and Rampart Cave Members change to purplish-red and green siltstone/shale facies of the Bright Angel Shale in east quarter of map area where they are included as part of the Bright Angel Shale map unit. Intertonguing and facies change relations between the Muav Limestone and Bright Angel Shale produce variable thickness trends. Overall, the Muav Limestone thickens from about 359 ft (107 m) in east part of map area to about 600 ft (183 m) in west part. In cross section only."

Gradational contact with underlying Kayenta Formation is marked at the lowest white or light-red massive sandstone cliff. Unit thins east and southeast of the quadrangle and thickens north and northwest. Modern erosion of the sandstone provides a rich source of loose sand for eolian transport over much of the Paria and Kaibito Plateaus. Thickness, 1,200 to 1,750 ft (366 to 534 m)."

Mr,"Redwall Limestone, undivided",#b3b3ff,"Includes, in descending order, Horseshoe Mesa, Mooney Falls, Thunder Springs, and Whitmore Wash Members, as defined by McKee 1963 and McKee and Gutschick (1969), but these members are too small to show at map scale because of the sheer cliff outcrops of the Redwall Limestone in general. Unit overall is light-gray to dark-gray, cliff-forming, thin- to thick-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained, fossiliferous limestone and dolomite. Includes thin-bedded gray and white chert lenses and nodules. Unit is exposed as sheer cliff in Grand Canyon, and just the top part of the Redwall Limestone is exposed in Little Colorado River Gorge but is too thin to show at map scale.

Clasts are primarily comprised of sandstone, limestone, chert, basalt and well-rounded quartzite and volcanic rocks that have originated upstream from distant upper basin uplifts. Terrace gravels underlie and overlie local basalt flows 3 to 122 m (10 to 400 ft) above Colorado River, southeast quarter of map area. Higher terrace-gravel deposits are partly consolidated by calcium and gypsum. Age of terrace deposits commonly between 0.100 to 0.150 Ma (Fenton, 1998).
